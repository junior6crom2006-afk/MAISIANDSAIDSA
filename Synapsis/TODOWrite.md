  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Implemented real Kyber512 key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation. All tests passing.

- [x] **Implement Zero-Trust Framework**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-r1-i1
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Implement Integrity Features (HMAC-SHA3-512, Merkle Trees)**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Added HMAC-SHA3-512 for message authentication and Merkle Trees for data integrity verification. Includes ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption as alternative.

- [x] **Implement Anti-Tampering Detection**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-r1-i1
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Implemented file integrity monitoring with SHA3-512 hashing, tamper detection, and baseline management.

- [x] **Implement Self-Healing Capabilities**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Implemented automated backup and restore system with self-healing workflow for tampered files.

- [x] **Implement ChaCha20-Poly1305 Encryption**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Added ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption/decryption functions with AEAD support. Integrated into integrity module.

- [x] **Implement HTTP REST API**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Added HTTP REST API with health check, system status, agent registration, and task submission endpoints using Warp.

- [x] **Implement MCP Server Autoconfigurator**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Intelligent MCP server configuration that detects installed CLIs, TUIs, and IDEs. Automatically configures transports and tools based on detected environment.

 - [x] **Implement Port/PID Protection Module**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-r1-i1
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Notes: Intelligent port moving and process protection to prevent interception. Can change ports and process identifiers dynamically without killing the server.

- [x] **Unify Server Logic**
  - Assigned to: deepseek-coder:6.7b
